**These are the proper video settings when using the 8:7 (pixel perfect) integer scale overlays**

custom_viewport_height = "672"

custom_viewport_width = "768"

custom_viewport_x = "256"

custom_viewport_y = "24"

**These are the proper video settings when using the 4:3 integer scale overlays**
**(due to wrong viewport area in overlay, 10pixel of the game image result covered by the overlay)**

custom_viewport_width = "896"

custom_viewport_x = "192"

custom_viewport_y = "24"

Notes
-----
**There are multiple sets of overlays in this folder, here is a rundown:**

Full Screen - just the core provided emulator settings, NO INTEGER SCALE
 
  * The full screen files are just borders and require no fancy video settings. 

  * They support both 4:3 and 1:1 aspect ratios.

Integer Scale - Use these when applying an overlay to an integer scaled image.

  * The integer scale files are ripped directly from the SNES Mini with no modifications

  * They support both 4:3 and 1:1. use the video settings above depending on which aspect ratio you want to use.
